## Step: install
Build and install the gt binary locally.

Run from the rig directory:
` + "```" + `
go build -o gt ./cmd/gt
go install ./cmd/gt
` + "```" + `

Verify the installed binary is updated:

		Title: "Bootstrap Gas Town",
		Description: `Complete setup of a new Gas Town installation.

Run this after installing gt and bd via Homebrew. This molecule guides you through
creating an HQ, setting up rigs, and configuring your environment.

## Step: locate-hq
Determine where to install the Gas Town HQ.

Ask the user for their preferred location. Common choices:
- ~/gt (recommended - short, easy to type)
- ~/gastown
- ~/workspace/gt

Validate the path:
- Must not already exist (or be empty)
- Parent directory must be writable
- Avoid paths with spaces

Store the chosen path for subsequent steps.

## Step: create-hq
Create the HQ directory structure.

` + "```" + `bash
mkdir -p {{hq_path}}
cd {{hq_path}}
gt install . --name {{hq_name}}
` + "```" + `

If the user wants to track the HQ in git:
` + "```" + `bash
gt git-init --github={{github_repo}} --private
` + "```" + `

The HQ now has:
- mayor/ directory
- .beads/ for town-level tracking
- CLAUDE.md for mayor context

Needs: locate-hq

## Step: setup-rigs
Configure which rigs to add to the HQ.

Default rigs for Gas Town development:
- gastown (git@github.com:steveyegge/gastown.git)
- beads (git@github.com:steveyegge/beads.git)

For each rig, run:
` + "```" + `bash
gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>
` + "```" + `

This creates the full rig structure:
- refinery/rig/ (canonical main clone)
- mayor/rig/ (mayor's working clone)
- crew/main/ (default human workspace)
- witness/ (polecat monitor)
- polecats/ (worker directory)

Needs: create-hq

## Step: build-gt
Build the gt binary from source.

` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}/gastown/mayor/rig
go build -o gt ./cmd/gt
` + "```" + `

Verify the build succeeded:
` + "```" + `bash
./gt version
` + "```" + `

Needs: setup-rigs
Tier: haiku

## Step: install-paths
Install gt to a location in PATH.

Check if ~/bin or ~/.local/bin is in PATH:
` + "```" + `bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep -E '(~/bin|~/.local/bin|/home/.*/bin)'
` + "```" + `

Copy the binary:
` + "```" + `bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp {{hq_path}}/gastown/mayor/rig/gt ~/bin/gt
` + "```" + `

If ~/bin is not in PATH, add to shell config:
` + "```" + `bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
# or ~/.bashrc for bash users
` + "```" + `

Verify:
` + "```" + `bash
which gt

` + "```" + `

Needs: build-gt
Tier: haiku

## Step: init-beads
Initialize beads databases in all clones.

For each rig's mayor clone:
` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}/<rig>/mayor/rig
bd init --prefix <rig-prefix>
` + "```" + `

For the town-level beads:
` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}
bd init --prefix hq
` + "```" + `

Configure sync-branch for multi-clone setups:
` + "```" + `bash
echo "sync-branch: beads-sync" >> .beads/config.yaml
` + "```" + `

Needs: setup-rigs
Tier: haiku

## Step: sync-beads
Sync beads from remotes and fix any issues.

For each initialized beads database:
` + "```" + `bash
bd sync
bd doctor --fix
` + "```" + `

This imports existing issues from JSONL and sets up git hooks.

Needs: init-beads
Tier: haiku

## Step: verify
Verify the installation is complete and working.

Run health checks:
` + "```" + `bash
gt status          # Should show rigs with crew/refinery/mayor
gt doctor          # Check for issues
bd list            # Should show issues from synced beads
` + "```" + `

		Title: "Version Bump",
		Description: `Release checklist for Gas Town version {{version}}.

This molecule ensures all release steps are completed properly.
Replace {{version}} with the target version (e.g., 0.1.0).

## Step: update-version

// DeaconPatrolMolecule returns the deacon-patrol molecule definition.
// This is the Mayor's daemon loop for handling callbacks, health checks, and cleanup.
func DeaconPatrolMolecule() BuiltinMolecule {
	return BuiltinMolecule{
		ID:    "mol-deacon-patrol",
		Title: "Deacon Patrol",
		Description: `Mayor's daemon patrol loop.

The Deacon is the Mayor's background process that runs continuously,
handling callbacks, monitoring rig health, and performing cleanup.
Each patrol cycle runs these steps in sequence, then loops or exits.

## Step: inbox-check
Handle callbacks from agents.

Check the Mayor's inbox for messages from:
- Witnesses reporting polecat status
- Refineries reporting merge results
- Polecats requesting help or escalation
- External triggers (webhooks, timers)

Process each message:
` + "```" + `bash
gt mail inbox
# For each message:
gt mail read <id>
# Handle based on message type
` + "```" + `

Callbacks may spawn new polecats, update issue state, or trigger other actions.

## Step: health-scan
Ping Witnesses and Refineries.

For each rig, verify:
- Witness is responsive
- Refinery is processing queue
- No stalled operations

` + "```" + `bash
gt status --health
# Check each rig
for rig in $(gt rigs); do
    gt rig status $rig
done
` + "```" + `

Report any issues found. Restart unresponsive components if needed.
Needs: inbox-check

## Step: plugin-run
Execute registered plugins.

Scan ~/gt/plugins/ for plugin directories. Each plugin has a plugin.md with
YAML frontmatter defining its gate (when to run) and instructions (what to do).

See docs/deacon-plugins.md for full documentation.

Gate types:
- cooldown: Time since last run (e.g., 24h)
- cron: Schedule-based (e.g., "0 9 * * *")
- condition: Metric threshold (e.g., wisp count > 50)
- event: Trigger-based (e.g., startup, heartbeat)

For each plugin:
1. Read plugin.md frontmatter to check gate
2. Compare against state.json (last run, etc.)
3. If gate is open, execute the plugin

Plugins marked parallel: true can run concurrently using Task tool subagents.
Sequential plugins run one at a time in directory order.

Skip this step if ~/gt/plugins/ does not exist or is empty.
Needs: health-scan

## Step: orphan-check
Find abandoned work.

Scan for orphaned state:
- Issues marked in_progress with no active polecat
- Polecats that stopped responding mid-work
- Merge queue entries with no polecat owner
- Wisp sessions that outlived their spawner

` + "```" + `bash
bd list --status=in_progress
gt polecats --all --orphan
` + "```" + `

For each orphan:
- Check if polecat session still exists
- If not, mark issue for reassignment or retry
- File incident beads if data loss occurred
Needs: health-scan

## Step: session-gc
Clean dead sessions.

Garbage collect terminated sessions:
- Remove stale polecat directories
- Clean up wisp session artifacts
- Prune old logs and temp files
- Archive completed molecule state

` + "```" + `bash
gt gc --sessions
gt gc --wisps --age=1h
` + "```" + `

Preserve audit trail. Only clean sessions confirmed dead.
Needs: orphan-check

## Step: context-check
Check own context limit.

The Deacon runs in a Claude session with finite context.
Check if approaching the limit:

` + "```" + `bash
gt context --usage
` + "```" + `

If context is high (>80%), prepare for handoff:
- Summarize current state
- Note any pending work
- Write handoff to molecule state

This enables the Deacon to burn and respawn cleanly.
Needs: session-gc

## Step: loop-or-exit
Burn and let daemon respawn, or exit if context high.

Decision point at end of patrol cycle:

If context is LOW:
- Sleep briefly (avoid tight loop)
- Return to inbox-check step

If context is HIGH:
- Write state to persistent storage
- Exit cleanly
- Let the daemon orchestrator respawn a fresh Deacon

The daemon ensures Deacon is always running:
` + "```" + `bash
# Daemon respawns on exit
gt daemon status
` + "```" + `

This enables infinite patrol duration via context-aware respawning.
