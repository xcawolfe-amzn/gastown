# Gas Town Architecture

Technical architecture for Gas Town multi-agent workspace management.

## Two-Level Beads Architecture

Gas Town uses a two-level beads architecture to separate organizational coordination
from project implementation work.

| Level | Location | Prefix | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Town** | `~/gt/.beads/` | `hq-*` | Cross-rig coordination, Mayor mail, agent identity |
| **Rig** | `<rig>/mayor/rig/.beads/` | project prefix | Implementation work, MRs, project issues |

### Town-Level Beads (`~/gt/.beads/`)

Organizational chain for cross-rig coordination:
- Mayor mail and messages
- Convoy coordination (batch work across rigs)
- Strategic issues and decisions
- **Town-level agent beads** (Mayor, Deacon)
- **Role definition beads** (global templates)

### Rig-Level Beads (`<rig>/mayor/rig/.beads/`)

Project chain for implementation work:
- Bugs, features, tasks for the project
- Merge requests and code reviews
- Project-specific molecules
- **Rig-level agent beads** (Witness, Refinery, Polecats)

## Agent Bead Storage

Agent beads track lifecycle state for each agent. Storage location depends on
the agent's scope.

| Agent Type | Scope | Bead Location | Bead ID Format |
|------------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Mayor | Town | `~/gt/.beads/` | `hq-mayor` |
| Deacon | Town | `~/gt/.beads/` | `hq-deacon` |
| Boot | Town | `~/gt/.beads/` | `hq-boot` |
| Dogs | Town | `~/gt/.beads/` | `hq-dog-<name>` |
| Witness | Rig | `<rig>/.beads/` | `<prefix>-<rig>-witness` |
| Refinery | Rig | `<rig>/.beads/` | `<prefix>-<rig>-refinery` |
| Polecats | Rig | `<rig>/.beads/` | `<prefix>-<rig>-polecat-<name>` |
| Crew | Rig | `<rig>/.beads/` | `<prefix>-<rig>-crew-<name>` |

### Role Beads

Role beads are global templates stored in town beads with `hq-` prefix:
- `hq-mayor-role` - Mayor role definition
- `hq-deacon-role` - Deacon role definition
- `hq-boot-role` - Boot role definition
- `hq-witness-role` - Witness role definition
- `hq-refinery-role` - Refinery role definition
- `hq-polecat-role` - Polecat role definition
- `hq-crew-role` - Crew role definition
- `hq-dog-role` - Dog role definition

Each agent bead references its role bead via the `role_bead` field.

## Agent Taxonomy

### Town-Level Agents (Cross-Rig)

| Agent | Role | Persistence |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Mayor** | Global coordinator, handles cross-rig communication and escalations | Persistent |
| **Deacon** | Daemon beacon — receives heartbeats, runs plugins and monitoring | Persistent |
| **Boot** | Deacon watchdog — spawned by daemon for triage decisions when Deacon is down | Ephemeral |
| **Dogs** | Long-running workers for cross-rig batch work | Variable |

### Rig-Level Agents (Per-Project)

| Agent | Role | Persistence |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Witness** | Monitors polecat health, handles nudging and cleanup | Persistent |
| **Refinery** | Processes merge queue, runs verification | Persistent |
| **Polecats** | Workers with persistent identity, assigned to specific issues | Persistent identity, ephemeral sessions |
| **Crew** | Human workspaces — full git clones, user-managed lifecycle | Persistent |

```

**Note**: No per-directory CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md is created. Only `~/gt/CLAUDE.md`
(town-root identity anchor) exists on disk. Full context is injected by `gt prime`
via SessionStart hook.

### Worktree Architecture

Polecats and refinery are git worktrees, not full clones. This enables fast spawning
and shared object storage. The worktree base is `mayor/rig`:

```go
// From polecat/manager.go - worktrees are based on mayor/rig
git worktree add -b polecat/<name>-<timestamp> polecats/<name>
```

Crew workspaces (`crew/<name>/`) are full git clones for human developers who need
independent repos. Polecat sessions are ephemeral and benefit from worktree efficiency.

## Storage Layer: Dolt SQL Server

All beads data is stored in a single Dolt SQL Server process per town. There is
no embedded Dolt fallback — if the server is down, `bd` fails fast with a clear
error pointing to `gt dolt start`.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Dolt SQL Server (per town)     │
│  Port 3307, managed by daemon   │
│  Data: ~/gt/.dolt-data/         │
└──────────┬──────────────────────┘
           │ MySQL protocol
    ┌──────┼──────┬──────────┐
    │      │      │          │
  USE hq  USE gastown  USE beads  ...
```

Each rig database is a subdirectory under `.dolt-data/`. The daemon monitors
the server on every heartbeat and auto-restarts on crash.

For write concurrency, each polecat gets its own Dolt branch at sling time
(`BD_BRANCH` env var). Branches are merged to main at completion. This
eliminates optimistic lock contention at any concurrency level.

See [dolt-storage.md](dolt-storage.md) for full details.

## Beads Routing

The `routes.jsonl` file maps issue ID prefixes to rig locations (relative to town root):

```jsonl
{"prefix":"hq-","path":"."}
{"prefix":"gt-","path":"gastown/mayor/rig"}
{"prefix":"bd-","path":"beads/mayor/rig"}
```

Routes point to `mayor/rig` because that's where the canonical `.beads/` lives.
This enables transparent cross-rig beads operations:

```bash
bd show hq-mayor    # Routes to town beads (~/.gt/.beads)
bd show gt-xyz      # Routes to gastown/mayor/rig/.beads
```

## Beads Redirects

Worktrees (polecats, refinery, crew) don't have their own beads databases. Instead,
they use a `.beads/redirect` file that points to the canonical beads location:

```
polecats/alpha/.beads/redirect → ../../mayor/rig/.beads
refinery/rig/.beads/redirect   → ../../mayor/rig/.beads
```

`ResolveBeadsDir()` follows redirect chains (max depth 3) with circular detection.
This ensures all agents in a rig share a single beads database via the Dolt server.
