A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-<rig>-<name> 2>/dev/null && echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/<name>/<rig>\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke <name>\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED <rig>/<name>\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: <rig>/<name>\nCleanup Status: <has_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash>\nHook Bead: <hook_bead>\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=<state>.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:<name>\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=<agent_state>\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:<name>,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show <hook_bead>  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-<rig>-<name> -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/<name>\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke <name>\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: <polecat> has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: <name>\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: <uncommitted-files>\nUnpushed commits: <count>\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/<name> 2>/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:<name> --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke <name>  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue <rig>/polecats/<name> \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: <polecat> stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat <name> reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `<rig>/polecats/<name>`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-<rig>-<name> 2>/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls <rig>/polecats/<name> 2>/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update <bead-id> --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: <bead-id>\" \\\n     -m \"Bead <bead-id> was assigned to <rig>/polecats/<name> which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip"
